      <h2>Configuring Weaver Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Inside the directory of every Weaver project there's the
        file <tt>conf/conf.h</tt>. That file is just a C header file
        and editing it you can change a lot of configurations of your
        game. This page lists all the different macros that can be
        defined to different values (or not be defined) and how it
        changes your game's behaviour.
      </p>

      <h3 id="basic">Basic Macros</h3>
      <h4 id="W_DEBUG_LEVEL">W_DEBUG_LEVEL (0, 1, or 2)</h4>
      <p>
        This macro enables and disables debug messages in your game
        and also determines if your game is finished or still is in a
        development version.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a finished game, which is ready to be distributed, you
        should always set this macro to 0. You also needs to set this
        value to 0 if you wish to install the game with a <tt>make
        install</tt> command (don't forget to recompile it). When this
        macro is set to 0, a game run faster and without wasting
        memory in information for debug messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you set the macro to 1, the game will print messages warns
        you about non-fatal errors found during execution. If you set
        the macro to 2, warnings about strange conditions also will be
        print (but not always these warnings represent errors or
        things tht should be fixed). Values greater than 2 are
        reserved to Weaver engine development and should never be used
        in games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, fatal errors always halts the game execution and
        makes some error message appear in the screen, even when this
        macro is set to 0.
      </p>
      <h4 id="W_MULTITHREAD">W_MULTITHREAD (nothing)</h4>
      <p>
        This thread defines if the project should support multiple
        threads or not. If this macro is defined, all the functions
        marked as thread-safe in <a href="reference.htm">Weaver
        Reference Guide</a> becames thread-safe. If the macro is
        defined, all the functions that read game assets also try do
        do it's job asynchronously in a separated thread.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the macro isn't defined, then Weaver doesn't care about the
        possibility of multiple threads running the code and doesn't
        create mutexes and semaphores. All the functions became not
        thread-safe.
      </p>
      <h4 id="W_SOURCE">W_SOURCE (W_C or W_CPP)</h4>
      <p>
        This macros defines the language which we are using in aa
        project. There's two options: C (<tt>W_C</tt>) or C++
        (<tt>W_CPP</tt>).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of this macro, Weaver knows wich compiler should
        be used and also how the headers should be defined.
      </p>
      <h4 id="W_TARGET">W_TARGET (W_ELF or W_WEB)</h4>
      <p>
        This macro defines the target for the compilation. If the game
        should be transformed in a Linux executable (<tt>W_ELF</tt>)
        or in a web page in the form of optimized javascript
        (<tt>W_WEB</tt>).
