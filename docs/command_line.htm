      <h4 id="unstable">Compiling Unstable Version from Repository</h4>
      <p>
        Check Weaver repository
        at <a href="https://github.com/thiagoharry/weaver">
        https://github.com/thiagoharry/weaver</a>. Click in "Clone or
        Download". Or just use
        <a href="https://github.com/thiagoharry/weaver/archive/master.zip">

        Weaver was developed using literary programming technics. So
        before compiling the program, check if you have installed in
        your computer the following programs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CTANGLE (Classic program to write C literary programs
        created by Donald Knuth) or NOTANGLE (a more modern and robust
        program to write literary programs in any language). The first
        program can be found in
        the <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cweb.html">
        CWEB</a> package and the later is part of
          <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/">NOWEB</a>
          package.</li>
        <li>
          A C compiler. Currently we
          support <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>
          and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have all the dependencies, you can compile Weaver with
        the command:
      </p>
      <pre class="terminal">
make</pre>
      <p>
        Which should print the following message in your terminal:
      </p>
      <pre class="terminal">
Testing CTANGLE or NOTANGLE..OK
Testing GCC or CLANG.........OK
Compiling....................OK</pre>
      <p>
        If you found no errors, proceed with the installation running
        the following command as root:
      </p>
      <pre class="terminal">
make install</pre>
      <p>
        Which should print a lot of messages in your terminal to show
        all the files that are copied during installation. If no error
        messages were found, Weaver was correctly installed in your
        machine.
      </p>
      <h2 id="creating">Creating a New Game</h2>
      <p>
        After installing Weaver, you can create a new game project
        going to any directory where you wish to place your game and
        running the command:
      </p>
      <pre class="terminal">
weaver PROJECT_NAME</pre>
      <p>
        Where PROJECT_NAME is any name you wish to give for your
        project. Please, use ony alphanumeric characters. Weaver will
        also block your name if it would create some sort of conflict
        inside the project directory. For example, "Makefile" isn't a
        valid project name. Weaver also block the name if it
        corresponds to an existing file.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Weaver allowed your name, it should have created a new
        directory called PROJECT_NAME. Inside the directory, you can
        find the following files:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>COPYING</tt>: A file with the license. Any Weaver
        project have GPLv3 code. So, you are allowed to choose only
        compatible licenses for your code. Or just use GPLv3 too. You
        can read the GPL license in this file. If you don't want to
        use a compatible version, you should contact Weaver copyright
        holder and negotiate if he could license some Weaver version
          with a non-GPL version.</li>
        <li>
          <tt>Makefile</tt>: Weaver uses this Makefile to know how to
          compile your project. But you never should need to change or
          edit this file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>compiled_plugins</tt>: If you created a plugin for your
          game, it would be placed here after compilation.
        </li>
        <li><tt>conf</tt>: A directory with the
          file <tt>conf.h</tt>. Changing the headers in that file you
          can change your project configuration. You can choose, for
          example, if you want to use C or C++. Or if you want to
          compile your project for linux or for a Web Page to play
          online.</li>
        <li>
          <tt>fonts</tt>: Reserved for future usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>image</tt>: Reserved for future usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>models</tt>: Reserved for future usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>music</tt>: Reserved for future usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>plugins</tt>: The source code for your game plugins. You
          can create a new plugin running inside a weaver project
          directory the command <tt>weaver --plugin PLUGIN_NAME</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>prog.Makefile</tt>: Another Makefile to guide the game
          executable installation. You never should need to edit this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>shaders</tt>: Your game shaders. GLSL code that will be
          run in your GPU, not CPU. You can create a new shader and
          check the result running inside a weaver project directory
          the command <tt>weaver --shader SHADER_NAME</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>sound</tt>: You can put here any WAVE sound that you
          wish to use in your game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>src</tt>: Your game source code. You can create a new C
          file and header running the command <tt>weaver FILENAME</tt>
          inside a weaver project directoy. You can then place your
          game code. It's not recommended to change the code
          inside <tt>src/weaver</tt> directory. The code there isn't
          easy to understand because it was extracted using CTANGLE or
          NOTANGLE program during installation. And any changes made
          in that directory would be overwritten if you update your
          project to run with a new Weaver version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>tex</tt>: Reserved for future usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>web.Makefile</tt>: A Makefile to instruct how to compile
          the game as a web page. You never should need to edit this
          file.
        </li>
      </ul>
