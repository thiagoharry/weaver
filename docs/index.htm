      Weaver is a project which aims to be a game engine for Linux.
      Currently it is a nice environment to play with shaders which
      supports:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming in C and C++. With ever you like most!</li>
      <li>Compile programs for Linux executables and for web pages
	using Javascript and WebGL. Yes! Everyone can play online your
	games!</li>
      <li>Interactive programming. Change a program while you run it
	without closing the executable. You write the changes and they
	appear in the screen almost instantaneously!</li>
      <li>Shader editing using GLSL. You also can edit and create
	shaders interactively, seeing your changes almost
	instantaneously in the screen!</li>
    </ul>
