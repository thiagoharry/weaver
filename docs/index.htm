	to play with shaders which supports:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Programming in C and C++. With ever you like most!</li>
	<li>Run your games in Linux and in Web Browsers. Everyone can
	  play online your games with minimum loading times!</li>
	<li>Interactive programming. Change a program while you run it
	  without closing the executable. You write the changes and they
	  appear in the screen almost instantaneously!</li>

	  shaders interactively, seeing your changes almost
	  instantaneously in the screen!</li>
