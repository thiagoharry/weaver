      <h2>Weaver Main Loops</h2>
      <p>
        When you play a game you interact with some sort of virtual
        environment and with allies, enemies or neutral entities that
        also inhabit that environment. The computer creates a
        simulation in this environment in a loop which runs forever
        until some kind of condition puts you in another environment,
        which also runs in another loop.
