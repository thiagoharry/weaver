      <h3 id="#basic">Basic Functions and Variables</h3>
      <h4 id="basic_variable">Variables</h4>
      <h5 id="W">struct W <img class="icon" src="images/read_only.png"
             width="25px" height="25px" title="Read-only"></h5>
      <p>
        The <tt>W</tt> struct is a struct where you can find almost
        all the variables and functions defined by Weaver API. It's
        main function is act as a namespace, avoiding conflicts
        between user variable names and the API names. Almost all
        variables and functions listed in this page is
        inside <tt>W</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage of defining almost all variables and
        functions inside this struct it's that we can pass the struct
        to plugins and then they can have access to all Weaver
        functions and variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually you shouldn't worry about the <tt>W</tt> struct and
        never should need to pass it directly to some function. You
        just invoke it's functions and access it's variables.
      </p>
      <h5 id="game">struct _game_struct *W.game</h5>
      <p>
        This is just a pointer to the struct defined
        at <tt>src/game.h</tt> in your project. You decide which
        variables you create and define in this struct. This
        user-defined struct is a way to store your game's global
        variables and also where you put data that should be
        accessible for plugins.
      </p>
      <h5 id="t">unsigned long long W.t <img class="icon"
             src="images/read_only.png" width="25px" height="25px"
             title="Read-only"><img class="icon" src="images/loop.png"
             width="25px" height="25px" title="Main loop only"></h5>
      <p>
        This variable hold the times in microseconds since the
        program's initialization. A microsecond is 0.000001 second. So
        if you wish to know the value in seconds, you should divide it
        by 1,000,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this value is at least 64-bits long, this would overflow
        only after more than 500,000 years.
      </p>
      <h5 id="dt">unsigned long long W.dt <img class="icon"
             src="images/read_only.png" width="25px" height="25px"
             title="Read-only"><img class="icon" src="images/loop.png"
             width="25px" height="25px" title="Main loop only"></h5>
      <p>
        This variable holds the time in microseconds between the
        current main loop iteration and the previous loop
        iteration. As Weaver uses a fixed time step to run C code in
        the game loop, it's value should always be about 40,000, wich
        means that your C-code is running at 25 frames per second (but
        the game probably is rendering at a higher rate).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you check this value and it has a value much higher than
        40,000, it means that your game is running slowly. You should
        then do something like render less things, lower the
        resolution or the ammount of calculations in each frame.
      </p>
      <h4 id="basic_functions">Functions</h4>
      <h5 id="Walloc">void *Walloc(size_t size)</h5>
      <p>
        This function is like <tt>malloc</tt>, but the memory
        allocated is handled by Weaver's memory manager and usually
        don't need to be manually freed. The gargage collector
        will take away the memory allocated when you exit the current
        main loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should free the memory only if you use this function
        outside a main loop. Or if you just allocated the memory but
        won't need it anymore. In this case, use
        the <a href="#Wfree">Wfree</a> function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weaver garbage collector runs when you call the functions
        <a href="#Wloop">Wloop</a> (except in the first invocation)
        and <a href="#Wexit_loop">Wexit_loop</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tip:</b> Avoid calling <tt>Walloc</tt> in a main loop
        body. This leads to memory leaks. It's better to allocate a
        pool of objects in the loop initialization and then in the
        loop body you check which objects in the pool are initialized
        and should be handled.
      </p>
      <h5 id="Wexit">void Wexit(void)<img class="icon"
               src="images/not_thread.png" width="25px" height="25px"
               title="Not thread-safe"></h5>
      <p>
        This function exits the game immediately. The game window is
        closed and the program exits if applicable. You can't access
        any variable or function listed here after
        calling <tt>Wexit</tt>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="Wexit_loop">void Wexit_loop(void)<img class="icon"
               src="images/not_thread.png" width="25px" height="25px"

      <img class="icon" src="images/loop.png" width="25px"
             height="25px" title="Main loop only"></h5>
      <p>
        This function exits the current main loop, remove it from the
        stack and resume the execution of the next main loop in the
        stack. If there's just one main loop in the stack when this
        function is called, then it just exits the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The garbage collector frees all the memory allocated in a loop
        when you call this function. To know more about main loops,
        please check <a href="loop.htm">Weaver Main Loops</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="Wfree">void Wfree(void *memory)</h5>
      <p>
        This function frees the memory allocated
        with <a href="#Walloc">Walloc</a>. Call this only if the
        memory was allocated outside a main loop or it was allocated
        in the same main loop where we currently are. Otherwise, you
        risk calling the function in a memory already freed by the
        garbage collector.
      </p>
      <p>
        When in doubt, don't use <tt>Wfree</tt>. Just let the garbage
        collector do the work. If your
        macro <a href="configuration.htm#W_DEBUG_LEVEL">W_DEBUG_LEVEL</a>
        is greater than 0, then Weaver will print a warning in the
        screen if it detects a memory leak while exiting the game.
      </p>
      <p>

        works, check <a href="loop.htm">Weaver Main Loops</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="Winit">void Winit(void)<img class="icon"
               src="images/not_thread.png" width="25px" height="25px"
                                          title="Not thread-safe"></h5>
      <p>
        This is the first function you should call in a Weaver
        program. Only after calling this function you can call any
        other function listed here or read any Weaver variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the function who creates a new window according with
        the configurations in <tt>conf/conf.h</tt>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="Wloop">void Wloop(MAIN_LOOP (*loop)(void))<img class="icon"
               src="images/not_thread.png" width="25px" height="25px"
                                          title="Not
                                                 thread-safe"></h5>
      <p>
        If this function is called outside a main loop, it puts the
        loop received as argument in the loop stack and executes it.
        If this function is called inside a main loop, it stops the
        execution of the current loop, removes it from the stack, put
        the received loop in the stack and executes it. In other
        words, it substitute the current loop by the loop passed as
        argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        A main loop is where a game spends almost all the time, where
        we can get player's input and update the screen showing the
        objects created.

      <p>
        This function pauses the execution of the current main loop,
        put the loop received as argument in the loop stack and
        executes it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't destroy the previous loop. So the garbage collector
        won't free the memory allocated in that loop.

      <h3 id="numeric">Numeric Variables and Functions</h3>
      <h4 id="numeric_functions">Numeric Functions</h4>
      <h5 id="random">unsigned long W.random(void)</h5>
      <p>
        This function uses a variation of the Mersenne Twister
        algorithm to generate a 32-bits pseudo-random number. If you
        want your game to always use the same seed, set the
        macro <a href="configuration.htm#W_SEED">W_SEED</a>
        at <tt>conf/conf.h</tt>, otherwise Weaver tries to use an
        unpredictable seed, as a value read from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>
        or the current time in milisseconds.
      </p>
      <h3 id="window">Window and Screen</h3>
      <h4 id="window_variables">Window and Screen Variables</h4>
      <h5 id="framerate">int W.framerate <img class="icon"

                                              title="Read-only"></h5>
      <p>
        This variable holds the screen frame rate, the frequency at
        which consecutive images are displayed in your screen. Usually
        it's value is 60, which means that your screen is updated once
        each 0.017 second. Of course there are machines where this
        value can be different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't trust in this variable f your game was compiled to a web
        browser. There's no reliable way to discover the frame rate
        inside a web browser and so Weaver just guesses the value as
        60.
      </p>
      <h5 id="width">int W.height <img class="icon"
                 src="images/read_only.png" width="25px" height="25px"
                                       title="Read-only"></h5>
      <p>
        This variable holds the height your game have in pixels. It
        starts with the value defined in
        macro <a href="configuration.htm#W_HEIGHT">W_HEIGHT</a>. The
        value will keep updated if your window changes the size
        (either because the user resized the window or because you
        called the
        function <a href="#resize_window">W.resize_window</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If your game was compiled to a Web Browser, this variable
        holds the height of the canvas where your game is being drawn.

      <p>
        This variable holds your screen horizontal resolution. The
        width a full screen window would have in the screen. If your
        program is running in a web browser, this variable holds the
        width of the web browser window excluding toolbars and
        scrollbars (the same value present in
        Javascript's <tt>window.innerWidth</tt>).
      </p>

      <p>
        This variable holds your screen vertical resolution. The
        height a full screen window would have in the screen. If your
        program is running in a web browser, this variable holds the
        height of the web browser window excluding toolbars and
        scrollbars (the same value present in
        Javascript's <tt>window.innerHeight</tt>).
      </p>
      <h5 id="width">int W.width <img class="icon"
                 src="images/read_only.png" width="25px" height="25px"

      <p>
        This variable holds the width your game have in pixels. It
        starts with the value defined in
        macro <a href="configuration.htm#W_WIDTH">W_WIDTH</a>.  The
        value will keep updated if your window changes the size
        (either because the user resized the window or because you
        called the
        function <a href="#resize_window">W.resize_window</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If your game was compiled to a Web Browser, this variable
        holds the widtht of the canvas where your game is being drawn.
      </p>
      <h5 id="x">int W.x <img class="icon" src="images/read_only.png"

                              title="Read-only"></h5>
      <p>
        This variable holds the horizontal position of your game
        window in the screen. This position is defined as the column
        where the pixel in the center of your window is. The leftmost
        column is the column 0 and the rightmost colummn has the
        number
        <a href="#resolution_x">W.resolution_x</a>-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside a web browser, your game canvas can't move, so this
        variable is always assumed to have the value
        <a href="#resolution_x">W.resolution_x</a>/2 (Weaver assumes
        that the game canvas is centralized).

        This variable holds the vertical position of your game window
        in the screen. This position is defined as the line where the
        pixel in the center of your window is. The bottom line is the
        line 0 and the top lline has the number
        <a href="#resolution_x">W.resolution_y</a>-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside a web browser, your game canvas can't move, so this
        variable is always assumed to have the value
        <a href="#resolution_x">W.resolution_y</a>/2 (Weaver assumes
        that the game canvas is centralized).
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't change this variable. If you want to move your window,
        call the function <a href="#move_window">W.move_window</a>.

      <h4 id="window_functions">Window Functions</h4>
      <h5 id="move_window">void W.move_window(int x, int y)</h5>
      <p>
        This function moves your game window for the giver
        coordinate. The position x and y are in pixels and the
        position (0, 0) is in the left lower part of your screen while
        the coordinate (<a href="#resolution_x">W.resolution.x</a>-1,
        <a href="#resolution_y">W.resolution.y</a>-1) is the right upper
        part of your screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving a window to a coordinate means placing it's center in
        this coordinate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This function does nothing in a game compiled to a web
        browser.
      </p>
      <h5 id="resize_window">void W.resize_window(int width, int
        height)</h5>
      <p>
        This function resizes your game window. The width and height
        passed as arguments are in pixels. In a game compiled to a web
        browser, the function changes the size of the canvas where the
        game is drawn.

      <p>
        This array stores information about the user interaction with
        the keyboard. Each key has it's own position in the
        array. There's a set of macros created to help finding the
        right position in the array. To check if the key "A" is
        pressed, for example.  check <tt>W.keyboard[W_A]</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides <tt>W_A</tt>, you can check also
        for <tt>W_B</tt>, <tt>W_C</tt>, and all other letters, you can
        also check the digits <tt>W_0</tt>, <tt>W_1</tt> and
        others. The keys F1, F2, F3 and others
        are <tt>W_F1</tt>, <tt>W_F2</tt>, <tt>W_F3</tt> and so on. The
        arrow keys
        are <tt>W_UP</tt>, <tt>W_RIGHT</tt>, <tt>W_LEFT</tt>
        and <tt>W_DOWN</tt>. The Esc key is <tt>W_ESC</tt>. The Enter
        key is <tt>W_ENTER</tt>, the spacebar is <tt>W_SPACEBAR</tt>
        and the backspace is <tt>W_BACKSPACE</tt>. You also
        have <tt>W_TAB</tt>, <tt>W_PAUSE</tt>, <tt>W_DELETE</tt>, <tt>W_SCROLL_LOCK</tt>, <tt>W_HOME</tt>, <tt>W_PAGE_UP</tt>, <tt>W_PAGE_DOWN</tt>, <tt>W_END</tt>,
        <tt>W_INSERT</tt> and <tt>W_NUM_LOCK</tt> for keys Tab, Home,
        Page Up, Page Down, End, Insert and Num Lock. And there's
        the <tt>W_PLUS</tt> for "+" and <tt>W_MINUS</tt> for "-".
      </p>
      <p>
        The keys Shift, Ctrl and Alt are a little different because
        they have a left and a right variety. If you don't care if the
        key pressed is left or right, you can
        check <tt>W_SHIFT</tt>, <tt>W_CTRL</tt> and <tt>W_ALT</tt>. If
        you want to check for the right version of these keys, check
        for <tt>W_RIGHT_SHIFT</tt>, <tt>W_RIGHT_CTRL</tt>
        and <tt>W_RIGHT_ALT</tt>. If you want to check the left
        variety, check <tt>W_LEFT_SHIFT</tt>, <tt>W_LEFT_CTRL</tt>
        and <tt>W_LEFT_ALT</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also check if any key was pressed checking the
        position <tt>W_ANY</tt> in the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a key is not pressed, it's position in the keyboard array
        will have the value 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a key just started to be pressed in this frame (in this
        iteration in the main loop), it's position will store the
        value 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a key is being pressed, but the user didn't start to press
        it in this frame, it's position will store the number of
        microseconds since the user is pressing the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user released a key in this frame, it's position will
        store (just in this frame) a negative value witch is -1
        multiplyed by the number of microseconds that the key was
        kept pressed.

      <p>
        The mouse is represented by the following struct:
      </p>
      <pre class="codigo">
<span class="tipo">struct</span>{
  <span class="tipo">long</span> buttons[];
  <span class="tipo">int</span> x, y, dx, dy, ddx, ddy;
} W.mouse;</pre>
      <p>
        Weaver assumes a mouse can have 5 buttons. You can check if
        some of these keys are being pressed checking the
        positions <tt>W_MOUSE_LEFT</tt> (mouse left
        button), <tt>W_MOUSE_MIDDLE</tt> (mouse middle
        button), <tt>W_MOUSE_RIGHT</tt> (mouse right button) and the
        aditional buttons <tt>W_MOUSE_B1</tt> and <tt>W_MOUSE_B2</tt>
        in the array <tt>W.mouse.buttons</tt>. Keep in mind that not
        everybody have access to all the buttons. And if the game was
        compiled to a web browser, we may not to be able to check for
        buttons <tt>W_MOUSE_B1</tt> and <tt>W_MOUSE_B2</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a mouse button is not pressed, it will have the value 0 in
        the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a mouse button starts to get pressed in this frame, it will
        have the value 1 in the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a mouse button is getting pressed for more than 1 frame, it
        will have the value of microseconds since the key started to
        be pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if a mouse button is released in this frame, it will have
        a negative value of -1 multiplied by the number of
        microseconds that the button was kept pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The variables <tt>W.mouse.x</tt> and <tt>W.mouse.y</tt> stores
        thw mouse position in our game window. We considet the x axis
        as the horizontal axis and the y axis as the vertical
        axis. The position in the lower left of the window is (0,0)
        and the position in the upper right is
        (<a href="#width">W.width</a>-1, <a href="#height">W.height</a>-1).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get the horizontal and vertical speed of the mouse in
        pixels per second checking the variables <tt>W.mouse.dx</tt>
        and <tt>W.mouse.dy</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get the horizontal and vertical acceleration of the
        mouse in pixels per second squared checking the
        variables <tt>W.mouse.ddx</tt> and <tt>W.mouse.ddy</tt>.
