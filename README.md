# weaver

A Game Engine written in C which can be used to develop games in C or C++ and compiled to Linux executables or Javascript web pages

This project is under heavy refactoring, so it can't be
installed. This will be corrected soon.

Weaver is a literate programming project written in brazilian
portuguese which describes the building of a 3D game engine using the
C language.

To build and install the engine you can type 'make' and 'make
install'. You must have CWEB or noweb to extract and compile the
source code.

To build the PDF which explains all the source code, you can type
'make doc' and a 'weaver.pdf' will be created. You must have Knuth's
CWEB hacked with bigger buffers for this.

If you just want to read the PDF, you can check the file 'weaver.pdf'.

To use the engine to compile Javascript web games from C, you should
have Emscripten installed and configured.
